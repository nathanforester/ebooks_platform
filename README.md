#### Ebooks OOP & Database project

# Aims

### Database:

CRU(D) for:

- Customer details table (additional feature for password to be stored with username)
- Ebooks table (able to add an ebook using text wiring; searching for books to see if available)
- Requests table (extra) - users can create requests and administrators can add books to available on database once got
- Administrators table - can update books table with available books from requests. Can delete records including 
  customer input
- Sales/loans record tables - a record of each book transaction is stored with a unique ID


### OOP Python

- Separation of concerns can be applied to each table, although transactions and records must exist within the same class
- A DB connect superclass will need to be made (done)
- A runfile to test the functionality of classes and integration
- (EXTRA) A runfile will be made reflecting the modern day needs of web/app based GUIs
- Reliability of database connection determines the functionality of all integrated classes (if not stable, one can 
   'comment out' any instances of the connect class in the runfile - although this will produce 'object not found errors
   when attempting to execute in this way from the runfile)
 
### Notes and bugs

- documentation will be compiled as the project evolves. The plans in the database and OOP section also reflect 
  individual user stories, which are available via:
